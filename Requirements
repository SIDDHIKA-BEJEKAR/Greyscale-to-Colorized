Requirements:
1.)colorization_release_v2.caffemodel : 
	link: http://eecs.berkeley.edu/~rich.zhang/projects/2016_colorization/files/demo_v2/colorization_release_v2.caffemodel
	It is a pre-trained model stored in the Caffe frameworkâ€™s format that can be used to predict new unseen data.

2.)colorization_deploy_v2.prototxt : 
	It consists of different parameters that define the network and it also helps in deploying the Caffe model.

3.)pts_in_hull.npy :
	NumPy file
	
Second and third are already in the folder.
 
But first one will be needed to downloaded from the link : 
http://eecs.berkeley.edu/~rich.zhang/projects/2016_colorization/files/demo_v2/colorization_release_v2.caffemodel

Download the above caffemodel and save it in the folder comprising of main python file.
